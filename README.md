## üé® UI/UX Design Planning

### Design Goals

The primary objective of the UI/UX design is to create an intuitive, responsive, and visually appealing interface that enhances the user experience across devices. The platform should be easy to navigate, allowing users to search, view, and book properties without confusion or unnecessary steps.

### Key Features to Implement

- Clean and responsive layout
- Search functionality with filters
- Interactive property cards
- Clear navigation and breadcrumbs
- Booking summary and checkout flow
- Error handling and form validation
- Mobile-first design

### Core Pages Overview

| Page Name                | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Property Listing View** | Displays a grid or list of available properties with key info like image, price, location, and brief description. Includes filters and search bar. |
| **Listing Detailed View** | Shows in-depth information about a selected property including full description, image gallery, amenities, host details, and a ‚ÄúBook Now‚Äù option. |
| **Simple Checkout View** | Guides the user through the booking process, allowing them to confirm details, provide contact/payment info, and complete the reservation. |

### Why User-Friendly Design Matters

A user-friendly design is critical in a booking system because it directly affects user trust, satisfaction, and conversion rates. When users can easily find and book a property without frustration, they are more likely to complete bookings and return to the platform in the future. Smooth UX also minimizes errors and support requests.
